					<p>After the destruction of the Starkiller Base, The First Order fled into hiding. Luke now older has exiled himself from the Jedi Order because of his failed teachings to his nephew Kylo Ren.</p>
					<p>Luke senses the Force is strong in you but filled with much lost emotions. Due to this Luke decides to teach you the ways of the GREY JEDI CODE. Which is what he had been practicing since Kylo Ren's betrayal.</p>
					<p>But just as Luke teaches you, Supreme Leader Snoke has finished Kylo Ren's training in the ways of the dark side, allowing a broader sense of seeking out one's who are with the Force. With the location of The First Order found, The Resistance heads to the jungle planet Watak.</p>
					<p>You must use the Force to answer the following trivia questions to try to save The Resistance. General Leia Organa fears that this all seems too easy...</p>
